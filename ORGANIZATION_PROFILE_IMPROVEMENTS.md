1. New tabbed interface
2. Banner/logo upload section
3. Expanded form fields

5. Media gallery
6. Settings panel

Due to file size, this should be split into multiple components:

- `OrganizationProfileForm.tsx` - Main profile form
- `TeamManagement.tsx` - Team member management
- `MediaGallery.tsx` - Media upload & display
- `OrganizationSettings.tsx` - Settings panel

## üìù Notes

- All changes should be saved to backend
- Use FormData for file uploads
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Use toast notifications for user feedback
- Maintain consistent styling with donor dashboard
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Support dark/light themes
